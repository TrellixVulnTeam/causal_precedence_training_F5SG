Apical addition of 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB) or glibenclamide partially inhibited the rise in I(sc) induced by dDAVP and ISO in BAm-treated CFTR(+/+) CCDs, whereas dDAVP, ISO, and NPPB did not alter I(sc) in BAm-treated CFTR(-/-) CCDs. dDAVP stimulated the apical-to-basal flux and, to a lesser extent, the basal-to-apical flux of (36)Cl(-) in CFTR(+/+) CCDs. dDAVP also increased the apical-to-basal (36)Cl(-) flux in CFTR(-/-) CCDs but not the basal-to-apical (36)Cl(-) flux.

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185].

hgnc	MAPK14	CHEBI	rosiglitazone	bel	adipose glucose import	15777261	In principle, there are at least three mechanisms by which insulin could modulate GLUT4 function contributing to increase glucose uptake. First, insulin could promote translocation of pre-existing intracellular sequestered populations of GLUT4 proteins to the cell surface. Second, insulin could alter the intrinsic transport activity of GLUT4 proteins at the cell surface, by direct modifications of GLUT4 itself or by interaction with other regulatory molecules. Third, insulin could up-regulate the amount of GLUT4 protein by increased biosynthesis, decreased degradation or both (Watson & Pessin 2001). Although these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, the first model has been the most intensively studied. It is well established the participation of PI3K in insulin-induced GLUT4 redistribution to the plasma membrane in adipocytes and myocytes (Martin et al. 1996). Two classes of Ser/Thr kinases have been proposed to act downstream of PI3K, Akt/ PKB and the atypical protein kinase (PK) C isoforms f and k (Kohn et al. 1998, Bandyopadhyay et al. 1999). Conversely, the use of ML-9 compound as an inhibitor of PKB/Akt enzymatic activity (Smith et al. 2000) has revealed that the activation of PKB/Akt was necessary for insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation in brown adipocytes (Hernandez et al. 2001). Moreover, the chemical compound okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of proteins Ser/Thr phosphatase 1 and 2A, has been useful to investigate the role of protein kinase C zeta (PKCf) on insulin-induced glucose uptake. Primary brown adipocytes pre-treated with this compound have blunted insulin-induced PKCf activity, but not PKB/Akt or p70S6K phosphorylation. The metabolic consequence of PKCf inhibition is a blockade of insulin-induced glucose uptake (Valverde et al. 2000). These results summarized in Figure 2 indicate that PKB/Akt and PKCf activation seems to be an absolute requirement for the acute insulin induction of glucose uptake in foetal brown adipocytes. Furthermore, we have shown that inhibition of phospholipase C gamma (PLCc) activity either with the chemical compound U73122 (Kayali et al. 1998) or with an inhibitor peptide or with a dominant-negative construct, precluded insulin stimulation of glucose uptake, GLUT4 translocation and actin reorganization, as wortmannin did. These data indicate that PLCc, activated at least partially by PI3K, is a link between insulin receptor (IR) and PKCf through the production of phosphatidic acid (PA), and could mediate insulin-induced glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation (Lorenzo et al. 2002). Concerning the second model, a potential role for p38MAPK in the activation of GLUT4 transporter by insulin, independent of GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane has been proposed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes (Sweeney et al. 1999). In this regard, we have recently found that rosiglitazone produced a modest but significant increase in basal glucose uptake that is dependent of p38MAPK activation in brown adipocytes (Hernandez et al. 2003b).	6876

Although this event supports the efficient induction of immune responses, it might also interfere with processes that are susceptible to chronic inflammation, such as wound healing after tissue damage. Therefore, Gp96-mediated stimulation of the immune system requires tight regulation. Here we show that human thrombocytes specifically interact with Gp96 and that binding of Gp96 to platelets is enhanced more than 10-fold on activation by thrombin. Gp96 interferes with neither thrombin-induced platelet activation nor platelet aggregation. However, the presence of platelets during Gp96-mediated DC activation reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of DCs.	0070527	12028	11848

In cell culture, omission of glutamine (a cofactor of GFA) from the media, or addition of glutamine analogues, blunts the desensitizing effect of glucose on insulin sensitivity (150). Glucosamine infusion for two to six hours will decrease insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, PI3-kinase activation, and activation of glycogen synthase in a manner that parallels the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.

hgnc	FKBP1A	hgnc	RYR1	SCHEM	Calcium	14715909	5. Myosin (de)phosphorylation and muscle contraction The contractile function of actomyosin culminates in muscle tissue. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chains is sufficient to trigger contraction in smooth muscle (192). This phosphorylation is promoted by raising the concentration of Ca2+, which activates MLCK. The Ca2+-independent net increase in phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains induced by Rho-kinase (139), ILK (264), ZIPK (264), and ZIPK-like kinase (55, 231) sensitizes muscles to Ca2+. Muscle contractility is also influenced by variations in the composition of myosin phosphatase. Thus the sensitivity of vascular smooth muscles to regulation by nitric oxide via the activation of cGMPdependent protein kinase 1-alpha depends on the presence of leucine zippers in the splice variants of the large and small Mypt that are expressed in this tissue (339). In chicken gizzard, a developmental switch between leucine zipperpositive and -negative Mypts correlates with the loss of cGMP-mediated myosin relaxation at hatching (203). Other forms of splice variance of the Mypt1-encoding gene have also been implicated in the developmental regulation of muscle contractility (108). The importance of the enzymes that control the contractility of smooth muscles in arteries (193), airways (182), and corpora carvenosa (381) makes them potential targets in the treatment of cardiac and cerebral vascular spasms, asthma, and erectile dysfunction. In striated muscle, contraction is triggered by membrane depolarization. Even though phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain is not required for contraction, it does positively affect the speed and force of contraction (346). Thus a gradient of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation correlates with the pattern of cardiac contraction (99). The role of the Mypt2-based myosin phosphatase in the contraction of striated muscle has been poorly studied. C. Scd5-Associated PP1 Fungi lack Mypt or Neurabin homologs, yet in budding yeast PP1 has also been implicated in the organization of cortical actin. Thus, after shifting of the temperature- sensitive PP1 mutant glc7-10 to a restrictive temperature, the actin ring at the bud neck disappeared, actin cables became rare, and actin no longer showed its typical polarized localization (16). This mutant was also de- ficient in vacuolar fusion and in secretory and endocytotic vesicular transport (292). Strikingly similar phenotypes were observed after the functional disruption of Scd5, Rvs167, or Sla2 (32, 59, 167, 259, 277). Scd5 has been identified as a PP1-binding protein in various screens (173, 372, 374), and recently, it was found that disruption of the RVXF motif of Scd5 that mediates the interaction with PP1 severely disturbed endocytosis and actin organization (78). Rvs167 and Sla2 interact physically and genetically with Scd5 (32, 59, 167, 259). Also, mutation of either Rvs167 or Sla2, like that of PP1, compromised the integrity of the cell wall at high temperatures, presumably because of a disruption in the transport of vesicles with cargoes required for the construction of the cell wall (16, 59, 259). Collectively, the available data indicate that PP1, Scd5, Rvs167, and Sla2 function together in a signaling pathway that regulates vesicular transport and the polarized distribution of actin patches. Possibly, Scd5 targets PP1 to actin patches and vesicles. Potential substrates of Scd5-associated PP1 include the phosphoproteins Sla2, Sla1, and Pan1. The latter two proteins have both been found to interact with PP1 in yeast two-hybrid screens (372, 374) and to be components of a complex involved in actin organization, endocytosis, and cell wall morphogenesis (357). Because homologs of various proteins introduced in this section have been identified in animals, where they have also been implicated in actin organization and endocytosis (167), it is tempting to speculate...	3711	10483

SCHEM	serum insulin	mesh	Exercise	go	skeletal muscle hypertrophy	15294054	Indeed, each of these select proteins is indispensable in mediating skeletal muscle growth and, whereas proposing the up-regulation of distinct proteins as potential markers of hypertrophy is tempting, a coordinated response from multiple signal transduction pathways is essential to the overall process. Integration of signalling by insulin, amino acids and resistance exercise A thorough review of amino acids and insulin and their contribution to regulating skeletal muscle protein synthesis is beyond the scope of the present paper. Thus, the intent of the present brief overview will be to focus exclusively on the impact of amino acids or insulin on protein synthesis in the context of resistance exercise. Without question, investigating the singular role of amino acids or insulin in promoting changes in skeletal muscle protein synthesis with resistance exercise is crucial to elucidating mechanisms regulating muscle hypertrophy. However, in a physiological state the concept is essentially irrelevant, as insulin and amino acids do not function in isolation because both participate to optimize the anabolic response in skeletal muscle. Nonetheless, key findings in both areas will be briefly highlighted to emphasize their contribution with resistance exercise. Although insulin concentrations remain relatively unchanged in the recovery period following resistance exercise (Kraemer et al. 1998; Biolo et al. 1999; Hernandez et al. 2000), a permissive amount of insulin is required to mediate increases in skeletal-muscle protein synthesis.

SCHEM	Prolinedithiocarbamate	mgi	Il1b	fplx	Nfkb Complex	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...		96543	NFkappaB

hgnc	FKBP1A	hgnc	RYR2	SCHEM	Calcium	14715909	5. Myosin (de)phosphorylation and muscle contraction The contractile function of actomyosin culminates in muscle tissue. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chains is sufficient to trigger contraction in smooth muscle (192). This phosphorylation is promoted by raising the concentration of Ca2+, which activates MLCK. The Ca2+-independent net increase in phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains induced by Rho-kinase (139), ILK (264), ZIPK (264), and ZIPK-like kinase (55, 231) sensitizes muscles to Ca2+. Muscle contractility is also influenced by variations in the composition of myosin phosphatase. Thus the sensitivity of vascular smooth muscles to regulation by nitric oxide via the activation of cGMPdependent protein kinase 1-alpha depends on the presence of leucine zippers in the splice variants of the large and small Mypt that are expressed in this tissue (339). In chicken gizzard, a developmental switch between leucine zipperpositive and -negative Mypts correlates with the loss of cGMP-mediated myosin relaxation at hatching (203). Other forms of splice variance of the Mypt1-encoding gene have also been implicated in the developmental regulation of muscle contractility (108). The importance of the enzymes that control the contractility of smooth muscles in arteries (193), airways (182), and corpora carvenosa (381) makes them potential targets in the treatment of cardiac and cerebral vascular spasms, asthma, and erectile dysfunction. In striated muscle, contraction is triggered by membrane depolarization. Even though phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain is not required for contraction, it does positively affect the speed and force of contraction (346). Thus a gradient of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation correlates with the pattern of cardiac contraction (99). The role of the Mypt2-based myosin phosphatase in the contraction of striated muscle has been poorly studied. C. Scd5-Associated PP1 Fungi lack Mypt or Neurabin homologs, yet in budding yeast PP1 has also been implicated in the organization of cortical actin. Thus, after shifting of the temperature- sensitive PP1 mutant glc7-10 to a restrictive temperature, the actin ring at the bud neck disappeared, actin cables became rare, and actin no longer showed its typical polarized localization (16). This mutant was also de- ficient in vacuolar fusion and in secretory and endocytotic vesicular transport (292). Strikingly similar phenotypes were observed after the functional disruption of Scd5, Rvs167, or Sla2 (32, 59, 167, 259, 277). Scd5 has been identified as a PP1-binding protein in various screens (173, 372, 374), and recently, it was found that disruption of the RVXF motif of Scd5 that mediates the interaction with PP1 severely disturbed endocytosis and actin organization (78). Rvs167 and Sla2 interact physically and genetically with Scd5 (32, 59, 167, 259). Also, mutation of either Rvs167 or Sla2, like that of PP1, compromised the integrity of the cell wall at high temperatures, presumably because of a disruption in the transport of vesicles with cargoes required for the construction of the cell wall (16, 59, 259). Collectively, the available data indicate that PP1, Scd5, Rvs167, and Sla2 function together in a signaling pathway that regulates vesicular transport and the polarized distribution of actin patches. Possibly, Scd5 targets PP1 to actin patches and vesicles. Potential substrates of Scd5-associated PP1 include the phosphoproteins Sla2, Sla1, and Pan1. The latter two proteins have both been found to interact with PP1 in yeast two-hybrid screens (372, 374) and to be components of a complex involved in actin organization, endocytosis, and cell wall morphogenesis (357). Because homologs of various proteins introduced in this section have been identified in animals, where they have also been implicated in actin organization and endocytosis (167), it is tempting to speculate...	3711	10484

Effective inhibitors of PI3K may help to define the role of this enzyme and its products in cells. In this regard, the use of two unrelated chemical inhibitors of PI3K enzymatic activity, wortmannin (a cell-permeable fungal metabolite that blocks the catalytic activity of the enzyme by interfering with p85-p110 interaction without affecting upstream signalling events) (Okada et al. 1994) and LY294002 (that acts on the ATP-binding site of the enzyme) (Vlahos et al. 1994), has allowed us to define the contribution of this pathway in inducing the expression of various metabolic genes. Experiments performed in our laboratory have shown that the expression of FAS and malic enzyme induced by IGF-I or insulin was completely prevented by treatment of primary brown adipocytes with either wortmannin or LY294002.

hgnc	FKBP1A	hgnc	RYR3	SCHEM	Calcium	14715909	5. Myosin (de)phosphorylation and muscle contraction The contractile function of actomyosin culminates in muscle tissue. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chains is sufficient to trigger contraction in smooth muscle (192). This phosphorylation is promoted by raising the concentration of Ca2+, which activates MLCK. The Ca2+-independent net increase in phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains induced by Rho-kinase (139), ILK (264), ZIPK (264), and ZIPK-like kinase (55, 231) sensitizes muscles to Ca2+. Muscle contractility is also influenced by variations in the composition of myosin phosphatase. Thus the sensitivity of vascular smooth muscles to regulation by nitric oxide via the activation of cGMPdependent protein kinase 1-alpha depends on the presence of leucine zippers in the splice variants of the large and small Mypt that are expressed in this tissue (339). In chicken gizzard, a developmental switch between leucine zipperpositive and -negative Mypts correlates with the loss of cGMP-mediated myosin relaxation at hatching (203). Other forms of splice variance of the Mypt1-encoding gene have also been implicated in the developmental regulation of muscle contractility (108). The importance of the enzymes that control the contractility of smooth muscles in arteries (193), airways (182), and corpora carvenosa (381) makes them potential targets in the treatment of cardiac and cerebral vascular spasms, asthma, and erectile dysfunction. In striated muscle, contraction is triggered by membrane depolarization. Even though phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain is not required for contraction, it does positively affect the speed and force of contraction (346). Thus a gradient of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation correlates with the pattern of cardiac contraction (99). The role of the Mypt2-based myosin phosphatase in the contraction of striated muscle has been poorly studied. C. Scd5-Associated PP1 Fungi lack Mypt or Neurabin homologs, yet in budding yeast PP1 has also been implicated in the organization of cortical actin. Thus, after shifting of the temperature- sensitive PP1 mutant glc7-10 to a restrictive temperature, the actin ring at the bud neck disappeared, actin cables became rare, and actin no longer showed its typical polarized localization (16). This mutant was also de- ficient in vacuolar fusion and in secretory and endocytotic vesicular transport (292). Strikingly similar phenotypes were observed after the functional disruption of Scd5, Rvs167, or Sla2 (32, 59, 167, 259, 277). Scd5 has been identified as a PP1-binding protein in various screens (173, 372, 374), and recently, it was found that disruption of the RVXF motif of Scd5 that mediates the interaction with PP1 severely disturbed endocytosis and actin organization (78). Rvs167 and Sla2 interact physically and genetically with Scd5 (32, 59, 167, 259). Also, mutation of either Rvs167 or Sla2, like that of PP1, compromised the integrity of the cell wall at high temperatures, presumably because of a disruption in the transport of vesicles with cargoes required for the construction of the cell wall (16, 59, 259). Collectively, the available data indicate that PP1, Scd5, Rvs167, and Sla2 function together in a signaling pathway that regulates vesicular transport and the polarized distribution of actin patches. Possibly, Scd5 targets PP1 to actin patches and vesicles. Potential substrates of Scd5-associated PP1 include the phosphoproteins Sla2, Sla1, and Pan1. The latter two proteins have both been found to interact with PP1 in yeast two-hybrid screens (372, 374) and to be components of a complex involved in actin organization, endocytosis, and cell wall morphogenesis (357). Because homologs of various proteins introduced in this section have been identified in animals, where they have also been implicated in actin organization and endocytosis (167), it is tempting to speculate...	3711	10485

(100) observed increased circulating resistin levels in diet-induced and genetic models of obesity. Inhibition of resistin in these models restored insulin action, whereas administration of resistin inhibited insulin action in control animals. Surprisingly, the evidence linking resistin to diabetes and obesity in humans is less clear. Serum content of resistin is unaffected by obesity and insulin resistance in humans (37). Lee et al. (66) compared BMI, fat mass, and insulin action to resistin levels in 243 subjects (male and female) and observed no relationship. There was also no difference in resistin between lean and obese insulin-resistant subjects. Serum resistin can be elevated in Type 2 diabetes patients, but there was no relationship between adiposity and insulin (70), whereas others have reported no difference in obese, obese diabetic, and nonobese subjects (37). Although there are conflicting reports as to the relationship of resistin to adiposity (5), most investigations agree that resistin is not related to insulin resistance (107). To date, there is no information on the interaction between exercise and resistin. Because the role of resistin in regulating insulin action is unclear at this time, there appears to be little rationale to investigate the influence of exercise on this particular adipocytokine.

In sickle cell disease, accumulation of heme, adhesion molecule expression, and an increased risk of renal failure have recently been demonstrated (Shiu et al., 2000; Nath et al., 2001a; Bonaventura et al., 2002; Frenette, 2002), strengthening the idea that heme-induced oxidative and inflammatory insults relate to its etiology (Wagener et al., 2001a).  B. Consequences of Heme-Induced Oxidative Stress and Inflammation  These recent observations may have widespread implications for the understanding of various inflammatory complications. It implicates, on the one hand, that at sites of injury, the released heme may be a physiological response that is necessary to recruit inflammatory cells, to initiate inflammatory processes, and to function as a first \""danger signal\"". However, on the other hand, excess of free heme may cause oxidative and inflammatory injury. In that case, it is of utmost importance to shield the oxidative and inflammatory properties of free heme; e.g., prevention of the formation of methemoglobin, which easily releases its heme, may be helpful in the design of safe \""blood substitutes\"".  This adds to the hypothesis that heme-induced inflammation is involved in the pathology of diverse conditions, such as renal failure, atherosclerosis, complications after artificial blood transfusion, peritoneal endometriosis, and heart transplant failure (Jacob, 1994; Nath et al., 1995; Alayash, 2000; Sato et al., 2001; Van Langendonckt et al., 2002).  Based on our findings, it seems important that packed red blood cells should be first washed before administration to a patient to prevent inflammatory complications during blood transfusions, since during storage a significant amount of erythrocytes will have been lysed, resulting in large amounts of free heme that may initiate inflammation. Alternatively, patients with increased vascular free heme, e.g., after intravascular hemolysis, may benefit from plasmapheresis or dialysis to dilute its potential damaging activities.  Furthermore, appearance of functional relevant polymorphisms for haptoglobin, hemopexin, and HO could be important for people with increased risk of heme release or people with already compromised redox balance, such as diabetes patients, sports people, or people undergoing transplantation or surgery. In case these individuals have a compromised protection against heme and heme protein-mediated inflammation priming of HO-1 expression or administration of heme/hemoglobin scavengers may protect them from injury.  For the hemoglobin scavenger, haptoglobin, there have been three major polymorphisms described that are associated with different prevalence of many inflammatory diseases, including infections, atherosclerosis, and autoimmune disorders (Langlois and Delanghe, 1996). Interestingly, these different polymorphisms possess also different hemoglobin-scavenging activity (Wuyts et al., 2000). Moreover, the carriers of the polymorphisms that are severely impaired in hemoglobin binding show to be more susceptible to cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis (Braeckman et al., 1999). This may possibly be explained by our findings of heme-mediated oxidative and inflammatory effects, such as foam cell formation, adhesion molecule expression, and leukocyte recruitment (Wagener et al., 2001b, 2003b). Interestingly, both polymorphisms in haptoglobin and HO-1 are considered risk factors for restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (Exner et al., 2001; Roguin et al., 2001).  C.

mgi	Hoxa1	SCHEM	Tretinoin	mgi	Gbx2	15722554	Homeobox (Hox) genes encode a family of transcription factors that regulate embryonic patterning and organogenesis. In embryos, alterations of the normal pattern of Hox gene expression result in homeotic transformations and malformations. Disruption of the Hoxa1 gene, the most 3' member of the Hoxa cluster and a retinoic acid (RA) direct target gene, results in abnormal ossification of the skull, hindbrain, and inner ear deficiencies, and neonatal death. We have generated Hoxa1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells (named Hoxa1-15) from Hoxa1(-/-) mutant blastocysts to study the Hoxa1 signaling pathway. We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.	96170		95668

SCHEM	Probucol	SCHEM	Oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein	hgnc	VCAM1	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...			12663

BAY 11-7082 is an irreversible NF-?B inhibitor that inhibits the IKK pathway to phosphorylate I?B, which is then degraded [24] and [25]. Figure 3 shows that pretreatment of NHBE cells with BAY 11-7082 accelerated hyperoxia-induced cell death. This accelerated loss of cell viability is independent of the presence of 0.5% DMSO, the vehicle for BAY 11-7082, because the extents of cell viability upon exposure to hyperoxia were similar in cells with or without 0.5% DMSO (Fig. 3). In contrast, an increase in the dose of BAY 11-7082 resulted in an incremental loss of cell viability in hyperoxia, indicating that inhibition of NF-?B can induce an accelerated, dose-dependent cell killing effect. These data suggest a protective role for NF-?B against hyperoxia-induced nonapoptotic cell death.		D018496	0008219

Effective inhibitors of PI3K may help to define the role of this enzyme and its products in cells. In this regard, the use of two unrelated chemical inhibitors of PI3K enzymatic activity, wortmannin (a cell-permeable fungal metabolite that blocks the catalytic activity of the enzyme by interfering with p85-p110 interaction without affecting upstream signalling events) (Okada et al. 1994) and LY294002 (that acts on the ATP-binding site of the enzyme) (Vlahos et al. 1994), has allowed us to define the contribution of this pathway in inducing the expression of various metabolic genes. Experiments performed in our laboratory have shown that the expression of FAS and malic enzyme induced by IGF-I or insulin was completely prevented by treatment of primary brown adipocytes with either wortmannin or LY294002.

The objective of the present study was to determine if the GPX1 protection was associated with phosphorylations of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p53 on Ser-15, two key signalling events in oxidative-stress-mediated cell death. Both Se-deficient GPX1 knockout (GPX1(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) mice ( n =64) were pretreated with an intraperitoneal injection of Se (as sodium selenite, 50 microg/kg body weight) 6 h before an intraperitoneal injection of paraquat (12.5 mg/kg). Liver aponecrosis, a mixed form of cell death sharing apoptosis and necrosis, was induced by paraquat in both groups of mice. However, its appearance was remarkably delayed and the severity was decreased by the repletion of hepatic GPX1 activity to <4% of the normal level by the Se injection in the WT mice, compared with that in the GPX1(-/-) mice. Consistently, the WT mice had lower levels of hepatic phospho-JNK, p53 and phospho-p53 (Ser-15) when compared with the GPX1(-/-) mice at 1-10 h after paraquat injection. Incubating liver homogenates with antibodies raised against JNK or phospho-JNK resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of phospho-p53 (Ser-15), and the amounts of the precipitated phospho-p53 were greater in the GPX1(-/-) mice when compared with that in the WT mice. The co-precipitated complex by the anti-phospho-JNK antibody was capable of phosphorylating intrinsic or extrinsic p53 on Ser-15. In conclusion, phospho-JNK may catalyse phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 in Se-deficient mouse liver under moderate oxidative stress, and attenuation of that cascade by low levels of GPX1 activity is associated with its protection against the pro-oxidant-induced liver aponecrosis.	104887	1346861	98834

In embryos, alterations of the normal pattern of Hox gene expression result in homeotic transformations and malformations. Disruption of the Hoxa1 gene, the most 3' member of the Hoxa cluster and a retinoic acid (RA) direct target gene, results in abnormal ossification of the skull, hindbrain, and inner ear deficiencies, and neonatal death. We have generated Hoxa1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells (named Hoxa1-15) from Hoxa1(-/-) mutant blastocysts to study the Hoxa1 signaling pathway. We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.	96170		109175

TNFalpha and flagellin increased JNK phosphorylaton and CXCL1 production from MODE-K.iXBP (50?90% reduction of XBP1) compared to MODE-K.Ctrl cells (Fig. 4CDE) that was dose-dependently and specifically (Supplementary Fig. 5AB) blocked by the JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (Fig. 4FG) but did not affect CD1d-restricted MODE-K antigen presenting function (van de Wal et al., 2003) (Fig. 4H). We conclude that impaired XBP1 expression directly heightens proinflammatory JNK/SAPK signaling in IECs in response to environmental stimuli and may contribute to Paneth, goblet cell and MODE-K.iXBP apoptosis (Fig. 2ACD, Supplementary Fig. 6AB).		104798	1346862

CHEBI	oligomycin	CHEBI	caffeine	mgi	Gamt	179611	N6,O2'-dibutyrylcyclo-3',5'-AMP injected to intact rats alone or in combination with theophylline increases the activity of guanidine acetate methyltransferase (GAMT) in liver and pancreas. Cyclic 3',5'-AMP and its dibutyryl analog administered immediately or two hours after the suturing of common bile duct (SCBD) stimulate the increase of pancreatic GAMT activity 2-3 fold. Glucagon, injected intraabdominally simultaneously with SCBD and administration of theophylline, dramatically increases the theophylline effect on the GAMT activity. The freezing of rat pancreas pretreated witn secretin, a hormone structurally similar to glucagon, results in a 1.5-2-fold increase of creatine synthesis from S-adenosylmethionine and guanidinacetic acid. An hour after glucagon administration to intact rats the GAMT activity of liver increases 9 times. The effect of glucagon is enhanced by insulin. Cycloheximide inhibits the increase of GAMT activity, induced by glucagon or a combination of glucagon and insulin. Experiments on tissue homogenates demonstrate that 3',5'-AMP in concentrations of 10(-8) --10(-2) M does not affect the GAMT activity or to some extent inhibits the enzyme. The homogenate incubation in a medium containing 10(-5) M epinephrine or 10(-7) M caffeine and 5 mM Mg2+ leads to an increase in the GAMT activity. Oligomycin removes the stimulating effects of caffeine and Mg2+ on the enzyme activation. This is probably due to the presence of 3',5'-AMP-dependent protein kinase in the mechanism of GAMT activation by cyclic AMP.			1098221

Treatment with CNTF or LIF increased levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity by 375 and 350%, respectively. However, in neuronal cultures depleted of protein kinase C (PKC) activity by chronic phorbol ester treatment, neither CNTF nor LIF elevated ChAT activity. Further, the stimulation of ChAT due to increased cell density was not observed in PKC-depleted sympathetic neurons. The inhibition of CNTF-stimulated ChAT by phorbol ester occurred in a dose-dependent manner and chronic phorbol ester treatments did not alter the levels of the catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. Moreover, increased levels of diacylglycerol, an endogenous activator of PKC, were observed in sympathetic neurons treated with CNTF. However, neither CNTF nor LIF stimulated the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. These observations suggest that a common PKC-dependent pathway, which is independent of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis, mediates the cholinergic stimulating effects of CNTF, LIF, and cell-cell contact in cultured sympathetic neurons.

hgnc	FKBP1B	hgnc	RYR2	SCHEM	Calcium	14715909	5. Myosin (de)phosphorylation and muscle contraction The contractile function of actomyosin culminates in muscle tissue. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chains is sufficient to trigger contraction in smooth muscle (192). This phosphorylation is promoted by raising the concentration of Ca2+, which activates MLCK. The Ca2+-independent net increase in phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains induced by Rho-kinase (139), ILK (264), ZIPK (264), and ZIPK-like kinase (55, 231) sensitizes muscles to Ca2+. Muscle contractility is also influenced by variations in the composition of myosin phosphatase. Thus the sensitivity of vascular smooth muscles to regulation by nitric oxide via the activation of cGMPdependent protein kinase 1-alpha depends on the presence of leucine zippers in the splice variants of the large and small Mypt that are expressed in this tissue (339). In chicken gizzard, a developmental switch between leucine zipperpositive and -negative Mypts correlates with the loss of cGMP-mediated myosin relaxation at hatching (203). Other forms of splice variance of the Mypt1-encoding gene have also been implicated in the developmental regulation of muscle contractility (108). The importance of the enzymes that control the contractility of smooth muscles in arteries (193), airways (182), and corpora carvenosa (381) makes them potential targets in the treatment of cardiac and cerebral vascular spasms, asthma, and erectile dysfunction. In striated muscle, contraction is triggered by membrane depolarization. Even though phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain is not required for contraction, it does positively affect the speed and force of contraction (346). Thus a gradient of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation correlates with the pattern of cardiac contraction (99). The role of the Mypt2-based myosin phosphatase in the contraction of striated muscle has been poorly studied. C. Scd5-Associated PP1 Fungi lack Mypt or Neurabin homologs, yet in budding yeast PP1 has also been implicated in the organization of cortical actin. Thus, after shifting of the temperature- sensitive PP1 mutant glc7-10 to a restrictive temperature, the actin ring at the bud neck disappeared, actin cables became rare, and actin no longer showed its typical polarized localization (16). This mutant was also de- ficient in vacuolar fusion and in secretory and endocytotic vesicular transport (292). Strikingly similar phenotypes were observed after the functional disruption of Scd5, Rvs167, or Sla2 (32, 59, 167, 259, 277). Scd5 has been identified as a PP1-binding protein in various screens (173, 372, 374), and recently, it was found that disruption of the RVXF motif of Scd5 that mediates the interaction with PP1 severely disturbed endocytosis and actin organization (78). Rvs167 and Sla2 interact physically and genetically with Scd5 (32, 59, 167, 259). Also, mutation of either Rvs167 or Sla2, like that of PP1, compromised the integrity of the cell wall at high temperatures, presumably because of a disruption in the transport of vesicles with cargoes required for the construction of the cell wall (16, 59, 259). Collectively, the available data indicate that PP1, Scd5, Rvs167, and Sla2 function together in a signaling pathway that regulates vesicular transport and the polarized distribution of actin patches. Possibly, Scd5 targets PP1 to actin patches and vesicles. Potential substrates of Scd5-associated PP1 include the phosphoproteins Sla2, Sla1, and Pan1. The latter two proteins have both been found to interact with PP1 in yeast two-hybrid screens (372, 374) and to be components of a complex involved in actin organization, endocytosis, and cell wall morphogenesis (357). Because homologs of various proteins introduced in this section have been identified in animals, where they have also been implicated in actin organization and endocytosis (167), it is tempting to speculate...	3712	10484

Similarly, the expression of pRb alone did not affect the activity of Gal4-MEF2C (Figure 3c, column 5); but, the combined expression of MyoD+E12 and pRb led to a 45-fold increase in the activity of Gal4-MEF2C (Figure 3c, column 6).

CHEBI	vitamin E	SCHEM	Oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein	hgnc	VCAM1	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...			12663

CHEBI	glucosamine	SCHEM	serum insulin	hgnc	GYS1	10194465	The ability of a variety of nutrients to activate the hexosamine pathway has led to the theory that this pathway serves as a general nutrient sensing pathway, through which hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia could decrease insulin sensitivity of cells when nutrient excess prevails (148). In cell culture, omission of glutamine (a cofactor of GFA) from the media, or addition of glutamine analogues, blunts the desensitizing effect of glucose on insulin sensitivity (150). Glucosamine infusion for two to six hours will decrease insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, PI3-kinase activation, and activation of glycogen synthase in a manner that parallels the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. This effect can be seen both in acute and chronic stimulation with insulin (151) (Patti, M.E., personal communication).			4706

Our data indicate that PLZF plays a significant stimulatory role in megakaryocytic development, seemingly mediated in part by induction of TpoR expression at transcriptional level. This stimulatory effect is potentiated by physical interaction of PLZF and GATA1, which are possibly assembled in a multiprotein transcriptional complex. PLZF interacts with the transcription factor GATA1 and stimulates the thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR) gene transcription, by activating a promoter region which contains a potential DNA binding site for the PLZF protein.	4170	12930	4444

mgi	Hoxa1	SCHEM	Tretinoin	mgi	Epha2	15722554	Homeobox (Hox) genes encode a family of transcription factors that regulate embryonic patterning and organogenesis. In embryos, alterations of the normal pattern of Hox gene expression result in homeotic transformations and malformations. Disruption of the Hoxa1 gene, the most 3' member of the Hoxa cluster and a retinoic acid (RA) direct target gene, results in abnormal ossification of the skull, hindbrain, and inner ear deficiencies, and neonatal death. We have generated Hoxa1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells (named Hoxa1-15) from Hoxa1(-/-) mutant blastocysts to study the Hoxa1 signaling pathway. We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.	96170		95278

mgi	Hoxa1	SCHEM	Tretinoin	mgi	Sox17	15722554	Homeobox (Hox) genes encode a family of transcription factors that regulate embryonic patterning and organogenesis. In embryos, alterations of the normal pattern of Hox gene expression result in homeotic transformations and malformations. Disruption of the Hoxa1 gene, the most 3' member of the Hoxa cluster and a retinoic acid (RA) direct target gene, results in abnormal ossification of the skull, hindbrain, and inner ear deficiencies, and neonatal death. We have generated Hoxa1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells (named Hoxa1-15) from Hoxa1(-/-) mutant blastocysts to study the Hoxa1 signaling pathway. We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.	96170		107543

Many factors contribute to the cellular damage resulting from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Experimental data indicate an important role for oxidative stress and the inflammatory cascade during I/R. We are testing the hypothesis that the mechanism of protection against I/R damage observed in transgenic mice overexpressing human antioxidant enzymes (particularly intracellular glutathione peroxidase) involves the modulation of inflammatory response as well as reduced sensitivity of neurons to cytotoxic cytokines. Transgenic animals show significant reduction of expression of chemokines, IL-6, and cell death-inducing ligands as well as corresponding receptors in a focal cerebral I/R model. Reduction of DNA binding activity of consensus and potential AP-1 binding sites in mouse Fas ligand promoter sequence was observed in nuclear extracts from transgenic mice overexpressing intracellular glutathione peroxidase compared with normal animals following I/R. This effect was accompanied by modulation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway. Cultured primary neurons from the transgenic mice demonstrated protection against hypoxia/reoxygenation injury as well as cytotoxicity after TNF-alpha and Fas ligand treatment. These results indicate that glutathione peroxidase-sensitive reactive oxygen species play an important role in regulation of cell death during cerebral I/R by modulating intrinsic neuronal sensitivity as well as brain inflammatory reactions.	104887	AP1	95485

CHEBI	acetylcysteine	hgnc	TNF	fplx	Nfkb Complex	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...		11892	NFkappaB

mgi	Hoxa1	SCHEM	Tretinoin	mgi	Hoxc9	15722554	Homeobox (Hox) genes encode a family of transcription factors that regulate embryonic patterning and organogenesis. In embryos, alterations of the normal pattern of Hox gene expression result in homeotic transformations and malformations. Disruption of the Hoxa1 gene, the most 3' member of the Hoxa cluster and a retinoic acid (RA) direct target gene, results in abnormal ossification of the skull, hindbrain, and inner ear deficiencies, and neonatal death. We have generated Hoxa1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells (named Hoxa1-15) from Hoxa1(-/-) mutant blastocysts to study the Hoxa1 signaling pathway. We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.	96170		96199

rgd	Hmox1	mesh	Ischemia	bel	tissue damage	15093717	BACKGROUND: We have shown that both intraischemic hypothermia and hypertonic saline resuscitation provide dramatic protection against gut ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury that is in part mediated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). We therefore hypothesized that induction of HO-1 by hemin would lessen damage and improve function after gut I/R. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 50 micromol/kg hemin (HO-1 inducer ferric protoporphyrin IX chloride) sq or vehicle 2 h before superior mesenteric artery occlusion for 60 min or sham laparotomy. After 6 h of reperfusion, transit was determined by quantitation of percentage of tracer in 10 equal segments of small intestine 30 min following injection into the duodenum (expressed as mean geometric center). Ileum was harvested for assessment of mucosal histologic injury (Chiu score 0-5 by blinded observer), myeloperoxidase activity (MPO, index of inflammation), and HO-1 protein expression. RESULTS: Hemin treatment was associated with increased HO-1 protein expression, lessened mucosal injury, decreased MPO activity, and improved intestinal transit following gut I/R. CONCLUSION: These data corroborate that HO-1 plays an important role in protecting the gut against I/R-induced injury.	2806	D007511

The ds RNAi oligo for Daam1 reduces the protein level of Daam1, but not of RhoA, ?-catenin (Figure 3C) or Dvl2 (not shown). Importantly, the RNAi oligo inhibits RhoA activation by Wnt-1, Fz, or Dvl, but not by Ephexin (Figure 3C). A control ds RNAi oligo has no effect on Daam1 or RhoA protein level or RhoA activation (Figure 3C). Thus, Daam1 is essential for Wnt/Fz/Dvl activation of RhoA. AN ACTIVATED DAAM1 INDUCES RHO ACTIVATION IN A RHO-GEF-DEPENDENT MANNER Previous studies suggest that deletion of the amino terminal domain results in constitutive activation of FH proteins by releasing an intramolecular inhibition (Watanabe et al. 1999; Tominaga et al. 2000 and Westendorf 2001). C-Daam1 thus may represent an activated form of Daam1. Indeed, while the full length Daam1 is inactive, C-Daam1 overexpression causes activation of RhoA, but not of Rac or Cdc42 (Figure 3D). C-Daam1 activation of RhoA is not affected by ?PDZ-Dvl (Figure 3A), which inhibits RhoA activation by Fz or Dvl (Figure 1F), further demonstrating that Daam1 functions downstream of Dvl in Rho activation.	3086	18142	667

CHEBI	acetylcysteine	mgi	Tnf	fplx	Nfkb Complex	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...		104798	NFkappaB

While moderatelydiabetic animals (fed arterial insulin, approximately 180 pM) exhibit an increase in protein synthesis rate as well as augmented eIF2B activity post-exercise, severely-diabetic (fed arterial insulin, approximately 72 pM) animals exhibit depressed protein synthesis rates and eIF2B activity at rest, which fails to change with subsequent exercise (Farrell et al. 1999; Fedele et al. 2000; Kostyak et al. 2001).

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...		5992	6881

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449].

SCHEM	Roquinimex	fplx	FGF Family	go	angiogenesis	12778130	Nevertheless, every tissue - including tumorigenic tissue - is dependent on adequate oxygen delivery. If oxygen is not sufficiently supplied, a battery of genes are induced by hypoxiainducible transcription factors (HIFs) that allow them to overcome hypoxic conditions34. Angiogenesis and tumour progression? The concept that angiogenesis is required for the expansion of a tumour mass raises the question as to when during tumour progression neovascularization occurs - is it simply a necessity to overcome size limitations, or is it coupled to a specific stage in a tumour's life cycle? There is increasing evidence from a variety of human tumours and mouse models of multistage cancers that angiogenesis can be switched on at different stages of tumour progression, depending on the nature of the tumour and the microenvironment. Historically, tumour-associated angiogenesis was thought to go through two phases, which are separated by the 'angiogenic switch' (FIG. 3). The first is defined as an avascular phase, which corresponds to small and occult lesions of not more than 1-2 mm in diameter. These lesions stay dormant by reaching a steady state between proliferation and apoptosis. Dormant tumours have been discovered during autopsies of individuals who died of causes other than cancer35. This supports the notion that only a very small subset of dormant tumours enter the second phase - the vascular phase - in which exponential tumour growth ensues. This same principle applies to tumour metastasis. Dormant metastases are a clinically difficult problem, as they can sometimes become activated by removal of the primary tumour10. Given the requirement of angiogenesis for growth and progression of dormant lesions, it would be assumed that inhibition of the angiogenic switch could prevent progression of tumours and their metastases. Preventative anti-angiogenic strategies could be especially useful in patients who are at high risk for developing cancer or recurrence of cancer, or development of metastases. A few experimental studies in animals, as well as in clinical trials, have already shown promising results. For example, angiostatin and endostatin reduced the formation of metastases in the Lewis lung cancer mouse model36,37.

CHEBI	ascorbic acid	CHEBI	1-octadec-9-enoylglycero-3-phosphate	hgnc	MAPK1	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...			6871

Surprisingly, phosphorylation of GSK3a at Ser21 and GSK3b at Ser9 in response to serum or insulin was only marginally affected in the SIN1-/- cells (Figure 3C). We also did not observe a difference in the kinetics of GSK3 phosphorylation between the wild-type and SIN1-/- cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the singly Thr308-phosphorylated form of Akt may be partially functional in vivo. We also examined phosphorylation of TSC2, another Akt target (Manning et al., 2002), at the Akt target sites Ser939 and Thr1462 and found no significant difference between wild-type and SIN1-/- cells upon serum and insulin stimulation (Figure 3C). Furthermore, we compared the proliferation rates of several sets of MEFs with wildtype, SIN1+/-, and SIN1-/- genotypes established from E10 embryos. No significant difference in the cell-doubling time of these MEFs was observed (Figure 3D). Finally, we did not find any size difference of wild-type and SIN1-/- cells grown under starvation or normal growth conditions (Figure 3E and data not shown). Hence, the growth factorinduced GSK3 and TSC2 phosphorylation may not fully depend on Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation.

SCHEM	Prolinedithiocarbamate	hgnc	TNF	fplx	Nfkb Complex	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...		11892	NFkappaB

hgnc	FKBP1B	hgnc	RYR1	SCHEM	Calcium	14715909	5. Myosin (de)phosphorylation and muscle contraction The contractile function of actomyosin culminates in muscle tissue. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chains is sufficient to trigger contraction in smooth muscle (192). This phosphorylation is promoted by raising the concentration of Ca2+, which activates MLCK. The Ca2+-independent net increase in phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains induced by Rho-kinase (139), ILK (264), ZIPK (264), and ZIPK-like kinase (55, 231) sensitizes muscles to Ca2+. Muscle contractility is also influenced by variations in the composition of myosin phosphatase. Thus the sensitivity of vascular smooth muscles to regulation by nitric oxide via the activation of cGMPdependent protein kinase 1-alpha depends on the presence of leucine zippers in the splice variants of the large and small Mypt that are expressed in this tissue (339). In chicken gizzard, a developmental switch between leucine zipperpositive and -negative Mypts correlates with the loss of cGMP-mediated myosin relaxation at hatching (203). Other forms of splice variance of the Mypt1-encoding gene have also been implicated in the developmental regulation of muscle contractility (108). The importance of the enzymes that control the contractility of smooth muscles in arteries (193), airways (182), and corpora carvenosa (381) makes them potential targets in the treatment of cardiac and cerebral vascular spasms, asthma, and erectile dysfunction. In striated muscle, contraction is triggered by membrane depolarization. Even though phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain is not required for contraction, it does positively affect the speed and force of contraction (346). Thus a gradient of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation correlates with the pattern of cardiac contraction (99). The role of the Mypt2-based myosin phosphatase in the contraction of striated muscle has been poorly studied. C. Scd5-Associated PP1 Fungi lack Mypt or Neurabin homologs, yet in budding yeast PP1 has also been implicated in the organization of cortical actin. Thus, after shifting of the temperature- sensitive PP1 mutant glc7-10 to a restrictive temperature, the actin ring at the bud neck disappeared, actin cables became rare, and actin no longer showed its typical polarized localization (16). This mutant was also de- ficient in vacuolar fusion and in secretory and endocytotic vesicular transport (292). Strikingly similar phenotypes were observed after the functional disruption of Scd5, Rvs167, or Sla2 (32, 59, 167, 259, 277). Scd5 has been identified as a PP1-binding protein in various screens (173, 372, 374), and recently, it was found that disruption of the RVXF motif of Scd5 that mediates the interaction with PP1 severely disturbed endocytosis and actin organization (78). Rvs167 and Sla2 interact physically and genetically with Scd5 (32, 59, 167, 259). Also, mutation of either Rvs167 or Sla2, like that of PP1, compromised the integrity of the cell wall at high temperatures, presumably because of a disruption in the transport of vesicles with cargoes required for the construction of the cell wall (16, 59, 259). Collectively, the available data indicate that PP1, Scd5, Rvs167, and Sla2 function together in a signaling pathway that regulates vesicular transport and the polarized distribution of actin patches. Possibly, Scd5 targets PP1 to actin patches and vesicles. Potential substrates of Scd5-associated PP1 include the phosphoproteins Sla2, Sla1, and Pan1. The latter two proteins have both been found to interact with PP1 in yeast two-hybrid screens (372, 374) and to be components of a complex involved in actin organization, endocytosis, and cell wall morphogenesis (357). Because homologs of various proteins introduced in this section have been identified in animals, where they have also been implicated in actin organization and endocytosis (167), it is tempting to speculate...	3712	10483

Ado elevated cAMP in Calu-3, IB-3-1, and COS-7 cells and activated protein kinase A-dependent halide efflux in Calu-3 cells. Ado promoted arachidonic acid release from Calu-3 cells, and phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) inhibition blocked Ado-activated halide efflux in Calu-3 and COS-7 cells expressing CFTR. Forskolin- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptor-stimulated efflux were not affected by the same treatment. Cytoplasmic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)) was identified in Calu-3, IB-3-1, and COS-7 cells, but cPLA(2) inhibition did not affect Ado-stimulated cAMP concentrations. In cftr(+) and cftr(-/-) mice, Ado stimulated nasal Cl(-) secretion that was CFTR dependent and sensitive to A(2) receptor and PLA(2) blockade. In COS-7 cells transiently expressing DeltaF508 CFTR, Ado activated halide efflux. Ado also activated G551D CFTR-dependent halide efflux when combined with arachidonic acid and phosphodiesterase inhibition. In conclusion, PLA(2) and protein kinase A both contribute to A(2) receptor activation of CFTR, and components of this signaling pathway can augment wild-type and mutant CFTR activity.		88388

Surprisingly, phosphorylation of GSK3a at Ser21 and GSK3b at Ser9 in response to serum or insulin was only marginally affected in the SIN1-/- cells (Figure 3C). We also did not observe a difference in the kinetics of GSK3 phosphorylation between the wild-type and SIN1-/- cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the singly Thr308-phosphorylated form of Akt may be partially functional in vivo. We also examined phosphorylation of TSC2, another Akt target (Manning et al., 2002), at the Akt target sites Ser939 and Thr1462 and found no significant difference between wild-type and SIN1-/- cells upon serum and insulin stimulation (Figure 3C). Furthermore, we compared the proliferation rates of several sets of MEFs with wildtype, SIN1+/-, and SIN1-/- genotypes established from E10 embryos. No significant difference in the cell-doubling time of these MEFs was observed (Figure 3D). Finally, we did not find any size difference of wild-type and SIN1-/- cells grown under starvation or normal growth conditions (Figure 3E and data not shown). Hence, the growth factorinduced GSK3 and TSC2 phosphorylation may not fully depend on Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation.

hgnc	HMOX1	go	response to hypoxia	go	inflammatory response	12869663	Overexpression of HO-1 can lead to hyperbilirubinemia in humans with certain hepatic disorders especially in patients in whom bilirubin disposition is impaired for developmental or genetic reasons, e.g., in newborns and in patients with the Crigler-Najjar Type I syndrome (Kappas et al., 1993). Drummond and colleagues have shown that pharmacological agents such as the inhibitor of HO, stannic mesoporphyrin, can inhibit HO activity significantly and is highly effective in a single dose in controlling hyperbilirubinemia (Martinez et al., 2001) (personal communication). However, such agents can exert only transient control of the activity of HO-1. Furthermore, the long-term overexpression or inhibition of different HO isoforms would have considerable experimental value in elucidating the role of the enzyme in physiological and pathological processes.  Quan et al. (2001) examined the feasibility of utilizing the retrovirus-mediated transfer of a human HO-1 (hHO-1) sense (S) and antisense (AS) orientation sequence under the control of the hHO-1 promoter to regulate endogenous HO-1 expression and function and thus permit development of gene transfer technology to regulate the rate of heme catabolism over the long term (Quan et al., 2001). Their data demonstrate for the first time that selective delivery of the hHO-1 gene in antisense orientation into human endothelial cells results in an attenuation of hHO-1 protein leading to a decrease in the rate of catabolism of cellular heme and that this effect is brought about without altering endogenous HO-2 protein.  Thus by using retroviral HO-1 antisense methodology, it is possible to envisage prolonged down-regulation of the rate of heme catabolism to its degradation product bilirubin in clinical or experimental circumstances where this might prove useful. Alternatively, inhibition of HO isoforms may be established using RNA interference techniques.  In contrast, the development of gene transfer techniques has provided the opportunity to deliver a functional HO-1 gene and to evaluate the direct effects of this gene on, e.g., vascular functions.  Using a retroviral vector, Sabaawy et al. (2001) established chimeric rats expressing the human HO-1 gene to study hypertension. Surprisingly, they observed that these rats, in addition to developing decreased blood pressure, grew significantly faster than rats lacking the hHO-1 gene, particularly during the first 12 weeks. Importantly, the increase in somatic growth associated with hHO-1 expression in rats was both proportionate and not associated with an increase in food intake. Interestingly, both human (Yachie et al., 1999) and mice (Poss and Tonegawa, 1997a) lacking the HO-1 gene display severe growth retardation.  An alternative means of establishing HO isoform overexpression is the use of TAT-HO proteins. The fusion protein of HO-1 to an 11-amino acid cell-penetrating peptide from the human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein enables efficient HO-1 protein entry and proved to protect pancreatic -cells against TNF--mediated injury (Ribeiro et al., 2003).  The importance of a fine balance of the heme-HO system is further underscored by accumulating data demonstrating that induction of HO-1 by gene transfer protects cells from hemoglobin/heme-mediated oxidative stress, leukocyte infiltration, and against a range of inflammatory complications, such as ischemia/reperfusion injury and hyperoxia-induced injury (Abraham et al., 1995b; Amersi et al., 1999; Yang et al., 1999). Moreover, it has recently been found that HO-1 gene transfer protects blood vessels from pathological vasoconstriction and excessive smooth muscle cell proliferation in animal models of arterial injury (Duckers et al., 2001). Furthermore, HO-1 transgenic mice are protected from hypoxia-induced inflammation and vascular dysfunction (Minamino et al., 2001). 	5013	0001666	0006954

Furthermore, these effects of E2F6 on BRCA1 depended upon the association of E2F6 with BRCA1 via its C-terminus in a UV-triggered manner and upon the transcriptional repression by E2F6 on the BRCA1 promoter.	3120	0009411	1100

mgi	Hoxa1	SCHEM	Tretinoin	mgi	Grb10	15722554	Homeobox (Hox) genes encode a family of transcription factors that regulate embryonic patterning and organogenesis. In embryos, alterations of the normal pattern of Hox gene expression result in homeotic transformations and malformations. Disruption of the Hoxa1 gene, the most 3' member of the Hoxa cluster and a retinoic acid (RA) direct target gene, results in abnormal ossification of the skull, hindbrain, and inner ear deficiencies, and neonatal death. We have generated Hoxa1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells (named Hoxa1-15) from Hoxa1(-/-) mutant blastocysts to study the Hoxa1 signaling pathway. We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.	96170		103232

A study investigating the control of TNF- synthesis by using reporter constructs has demonstrated that this AU-rich element and the flanking sequences are sufficient to mediate a more than 200-fold increase in the LPS-dependent synthesis of the reporter protein. This element is involved in both the control of mRNA degradation and its translation This increase is not due to a change in cytoplasmic mRNA concentration but rather to a reversal of the translation repression in response to LPS ...The consequent increase in PDE activity leads to a decrease in cAMP, thus removing the cAMP constraint and allowing a full induction of TNF- mRNA and protein synthesis.

CHEBI	acetylcysteine	CHEBI	1-octadec-9-enoylglycero-3-phosphate	hgnc	MAPK3	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...			6877

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...			6877

Because FAK binds PI 3-kinase, the protective effect against anoikis may be the result of PI 3-kinase-mediated activation of protein kinase B/Akt (52). Akt promotes survival, at least in part, by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating two proapoptotic proteins, Bad and caspase-9 (53) (Fig. 4). Inhibition of p53 prevents FAKdeficient cells from undergoing anoikis when deprived of growth factors, suggesting that p53 mediates the death signal under FAK deficiency (51).	9611	11998	D017209

CHEBI	acetylcysteine	hgnc	IL1B	hgnc	MAPK8	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...		5992	6881

ncbigene	12846	SCHEM	Sodium	ncbigene	492938	14654758	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) can modulate renal dopaminergic tone. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that COMT blockade protects from salt-induced hypertension. METHODS: COMT gene-disrupted (-/-) mice and wild-type controls received a high-sodium diet (NaCl 6%) for 3 weeks. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded by radiotelemetry. Tissue and urine samples were assessed by light microscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography. The effects of nitecapone treatment were also examined. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate during normal sodium diet were similar in COMT (-/-) and wild-type mice. The high-sodium diet increased night-time systolic and diastolic blood pressures in wild-type mice, whereas blood pressure in COMT (-/-) mice remained unaltered. In wild-type mice, the sodium-induced increase in blood pressure was completely normalized by treatment with the COMT inhibitor, nitecapone. At baseline, 24-h urinary excretion of levodopa (L-DOPA), dopamine and noradrenaline was increased by 145, 85 and 74%, respectively, in COMT (-/-) mice compared with wild-type controls. In COMT (-/-) and wild-type mice, a high-sodium diet increased urinary L-DOPA excretion by 405 and 660% (reflected as 102 and 212% increases in dopamine excretion), respectively. The absolute amounts of urinary L-DOPA and dopamine remained 60 and 20% greater in COMT (-/-) mice. The high-sodium diet did not influence renal cortical COMT activity. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that COMT deficiency in mice increases the availability of L-DOPA, leading to enhanced dopaminergic tone, which may be associated with resistance to salt-induced hypertension. The findings of the present study also underline the importance of COMT in the regulation of blood pressure, sodium excretion and renal dopaminergic tone.

This led us to generate mice that overexpress K8 S73-to-Ala (S73A), which mimicked the susceptibility of K8 G61C mice to injury, thereby providing a molecular link between K8 phosphorylation and disease-associated mutation. Upon apoptotic stimulation, G61C and S73A hepatocytes have persistent and increased nonkeratin proapoptotic substrate phosphorylation by stress-activated kinases, compared with wild-type hepatocytes, in association with an inability to phosphorylate K8 S73. Our findings provide the first direct link between patient-related human keratin variants and liver disease predisposition. The highly abundant cytoskeletal protein K8, and possibly other keratins with the conserved S73-containing phosphoepitope, can protect tissue from injury by serving as a phosphate \""sponge\"" for stress-activated kinases and thereby provide a novel nonmechanical function for intermediate filament proteins."	6446	6881	D017209

fplx	RHO Family	fplx	RAS Family	go	cell cycle	15572689	"Coordinate regulation of intracellular signaling pathways is central to the ability of mitogens and oncogenes to promote cell cycle progression (24). Two pathways thought to play an important role in committing quiescent cells into S phase are the RAS-activated RAF-MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3'- kinase)-PDK1-AKT pathways (35, 36). These pathways are reported to influence the expression, activity, or subcellular localization of key components of the cell cycle machinery such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK inhibitors (CKIs) leading to the appropriate activation of E2F transcription factors (50, 51). In addition to sensing the activation of specific signaling pathways, cells are also able to integrate the extent and timing of signal pathway activation and convert that information into an appropriate biological response (32, 48, 64, 66). For example, depending on the level of expression or activation, activated RAS can promote either cellular immortalization, oncogenic transformation, or cell cycle arrest in the same cell type (20, 48, 64, 66). Under these circumstances, RAS (or RAF)-induced cell cycle arrest is mediated by induced expression of CKIs of the INK4 or CIP/KIP family (29, 37). Interestingly, activation of \""parallel\"" signaling pathways can modify the ability of RAS to regulate the G0-G1-Sphase cell cycle transition. For example, RAS-induced cell cycle arrest in Swiss 3T3 cells is prevented by coactivation of Rho signaling pathways (9, 43)."	RHO	RAS	0007049

Our data indicate that PLZF plays a significant stimulatory role in megakaryocytic development, seemingly mediated in part by induction of TpoR expression at transcriptional level. This stimulatory effect is potentiated by physical interaction of PLZF and GATA1, which are possibly assembled in a multiprotein transcriptional complex. PLZF interacts with the transcription factor GATA1 and stimulates the thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR) gene transcription, by activating a promoter region which contains a potential DNA binding site for the PLZF protein.	4170	12930	0030219

Although this event supports the efficient induction of immune responses, it might also interfere with processes that are susceptible to chronic inflammation, such as wound healing after tissue damage. Therefore, Gp96-mediated stimulation of the immune system requires tight regulation. Here we show that human thrombocytes specifically interact with Gp96 and that binding of Gp96 to platelets is enhanced more than 10-fold on activation by thrombin. Gp96 interferes with neither thrombin-induced platelet activation nor platelet aggregation. However, the presence of platelets during Gp96-mediated DC activation reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of DCs.	0070527	12028	11850

CHEBI	acetylcysteine	CHEBI	hydrogen peroxide	fplx	Nfkb Complex	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...			NFkappaB

CHEBI	acetylcysteine	CHEBI	lipopolysaccharide	fplx	AP-1 Complex	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...			AP1

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...		96543	NFkappaB

In summary, microvessel density is only a useful prognostic marker for some cancer types. Overcoming angiogenic dependency? In contrast to tumour cells that are, by nature, genetically unstable and heterogeneous, endothelial cells are normal diploid cells that do not acquire mutations, and therefore should not become resistant to therapy. This rationale stimulated researchers to dream of a pantumour therapy focused on blood-vessel ablation. This dream, however, seems to be naive. Both animal and preliminary human clinical trials revealed that different tumours respond differently to anti-angiogenic therapy. Do these differences in response depend on the type or amount of angiogenic molecules that are expressed, or on other intrinsic tumour-cell characteristics, such as oncogene expression or resistance to hypoxia? Does anti-angiogenic therapy simply select for tumour cells that can grow at very low oxygen levels,without initiating neoangiogenesis or that use alternative pathways to circumvent neovascularization? Initial findings indicate that these effects might indeed happen in some tumour types.Anti-VEGF therapy in a rat model of glioblastoma resulted in decreased tumour vessel density and increased apoptosis.However, treatment also led to the increased co-option of existing blood vessels, circumventing the necessity of the tumour to initiate angiogenesis62. Examples of emerging resistance to anti-angiogenesis therapy include studies that showed that glioblastomas become resistant to TSP1 therapy63, renal-cell carcinomas become insenstitive to thalidomide64 and tumours that lose p53 expression become less responsive to combinations of low-dose cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic agents65.	11998	0001525

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...			6877

Suppression of PLD1 expression blocked S6 kinase phosphorylation in B16 melanoma cells, and suppression of either PLD1 or mTOR led to melanogenesis in these cells (19). Very recently, it was reported that PLD2 forms a functional complex with mTOR and its binding partner Raptor (known as mTORC1) through a TOS (TOR signaling) motif in PLD2 (21). The interaction between mTORC1 and PLD2 was essential for mitogen stimulation of mTOR(21). Thus, in addition to the ability of PA to activate mTOR, there are several studies that have shown a PLD requirement for the activation of mTOR.	9067	1736

SCHEM	cyclic AMP	hgnc	RAP1A	hgnc	RAF1	16170185	as shown in Figure 2.95-98 In essence, the activation status of Raf depends on the integration of both activating and inhibitory stimuli, the net result of which determines the downstream messages. THE RAF FAMILY OF GENES AND PROTEINS The raf family of genes was first identified as oncogenes in retroviruses that are the causative vectors of tumors in mice and chicken.99,100 The first raf gene to be identified, v-raf, the transforming gene of the mouse sarcoma virus 3611, induces fibrosarcomas and erythroleukemia in newborn mice, and C-raf (also called raf-1) is its proto-oncogene homolog.101,102 A-raf was found next by screening a mouse spleen cDNA library at low stringency with a v-raf probe. Next, v-Rmil was identified as the transforming gene in the avian retrovirus Mill Hill No. 2 (MH2) from a spontaneous ovarian tumor and found to be homologous to v-raf.99 C-Rmil corresponded to a third mammalian raf gene, B-raf, which was also shown to be an oncogene.103,104 However, initial attempts to identify activated versions of raf in human cancers failed to demonstrate unique DNA rearrangements in any specific tumor type, which, in retrospect, can be attributed to the lack of requisite sensitivity of early assays to detect single point mutations. Furthermore, most early efforts were directed at C-raf, rather than at the more oncogenic B-raf. The mammalian raf family consists of the following three genes: A-raf, B-raf, and C-raf, which are located on chromosomes Xp11, 7q32, and 3p25, respectively. The raf proto-oncogenes encode three 68- to 74-kd cytosolic proteins, termed A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf (Raf-1), which share highly conserved amino-terminal regulatory regions and catalytic domains at the carboxyl terminus (Fig 4).10 As serine/threonine kinases, Raf proteins phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on essential modulatory proteins downstream of Ras. Each Raf species has a distinct expression profile in tissues, which suggests that individual Raf isoforms perform clearly defined functions.4 C-Raf is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues. Both A- and B-Raf have more restricted expression profiles than C-Raf, with A-Raf overexpressed in urogenital tissues (eg, kidney, ovary, prostate, and epididymis) and B-Raf overexpressed in neural, testicular, splenic, and hematopoietic tissues.105 Unlike A-raf and C-raf, B-raf undergoes differential splicing in exons 8b and 10a, and its spliced variants are translated into 10 B-Raf isoforms.106,107 Both A-Raf and C-Raf undergo localization to the mitochondria, which supports the notion that Raf regulates apoptosis, but the specific proportions of Raf isoforms that are localized to the mitochondria are not known.108-112 This localization may be a result of isoform-specific lipid- or protein-binding partners, which recruit Raf to distinct membrane rafts. From a functional standpoint, although all Raf proteins are serine/threonine kinases and capable of activating the MAPK cascade, they have distinct downstream phosphorylation targets and play unique roles in signaling.113 Their distinct roles are supported by Raf knockout studies, in which mice lacking each of the three Raf proteins have disparate phenotypes.113,114 B-raf knockouts die in utero by day 12, usually as a result of massive internal hemorrhage, whereas A-raf and C-raf knockouts die postpartum with extensive intestinal distension (A-raf knockout) or failure of lung maturation (C-raf knockout). Additional support for the diverse functionality of Raf family members is provided by the disparate responses of B-Raf and C-Raf to identical stimuli, as well as the distinct messages that each isoform relays downstream to Rap1, which is a small GTPase that functions as both an activator and repressor of Raf.115 For example, Rap1- mediated stimulation of B-Raf by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) phosphorylates ERK, whereas stimulation of C-Raf inhibits ERK phosphorylation.115		9855	9829

Effective inhibitors of PI3K may help to define the role of this enzyme and its products in cells. In this regard, the use of two unrelated chemical inhibitors of PI3K enzymatic activity, wortmannin (a cell-permeable fungal metabolite that blocks the catalytic activity of the enzyme by interfering with p85-p110 interaction without affecting upstream signalling events) (Okada et al. 1994) and LY294002 (that acts on the ATP-binding site of the enzyme) (Vlahos et al. 1994), has allowed us to define the contribution of this pathway in inducing the expression of various metabolic genes. Experiments performed in our laboratory have shown that the expression of FAS and malic enzyme induced by IGF-I or insulin was completely prevented by treatment of primary brown adipocytes with either wortmannin or LY294002.

hgnc	CALR	fplx	C1q Complex	CHEBI	reactive oxygen species	12576225	Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the most challenging brain disorders facing modern medicine. Neuronal loss underlies the pathogenesis of AD and can occur, in part, by oxidative stress, by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), and by excitotoxins. The complement cascade, especially C1q, may affect reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mediate neuronal injury during AD. We demonstrate that incubation of neurons with purified C1q results in increased ROS, which can be partially blocked by low concentrations of Abeta. C1q-binding sites on neurons were demonstrated by 125I-C1q-binding and immunofluorescence tests performed on primary neurons. The blocking of neuronal calreticulin by its antibody abrogated ROS by C1q. We suggest that the C1q may be an important factor contributing to neuronal oxidative stress and neuronal demise during AD.	1455	C1q

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185].

mgi	Cat	mgi	Tnf	fplx	Nfkb Complex	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124].

Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...	11180	11892	NFkappaB

In cell culture, omission of glutamine (a cofactor of GFA) from the media, or addition of glutamine analogues, blunts the desensitizing effect of glucose on insulin sensitivity (150). Glucosamine infusion for two to six hours will decrease insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, PI3-kinase activation, and activation of glycogen synthase in a manner that parallels the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. This effect can be seen both in acute and chronic stimulation with insulin (151) (Patti, M.E., personal communication).			4707

This accumulation was inhibited when inhibitors of the ?-nAChR were added, demonstrating the specificity of this nicotine driven effect (Fig. 5A). The involvement of HB-EGF in the phenotypical changes observed was also supported by the fact that a single exposure of NHBE cells to 20 ng/mL of HB-EGF induced the protrusion of cell filopodia in these cells (Fig. 5B).			3059

TNFalpha and flagellin increased JNK phosphorylaton and CXCL1 production from MODE-K.iXBP (50?90% reduction of XBP1) compared to MODE-K.Ctrl cells (Fig. 4CDE) that was dose-dependently and specifically (Supplementary Fig. 5AB) blocked by the JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (Fig. 4FG) but did not affect CD1d-restricted MODE-K antigen presenting function (van de Wal et al., 2003) (Fig. 4H).

CHEBI	acetylcysteine	rgd	Pdgfb	rgd	Mapk14	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...		3283	70496

hgnc	FKBP1B	hgnc	RYR3	SCHEM	Calcium	14715909	5. Myosin (de)phosphorylation and muscle contraction The contractile function of actomyosin culminates in muscle tissue. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chains is sufficient to trigger contraction in smooth muscle (192). This phosphorylation is promoted by raising the concentration of Ca2+, which activates MLCK. The Ca2+-independent net increase in phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains induced by Rho-kinase (139), ILK (264), ZIPK (264), and ZIPK-like kinase (55, 231) sensitizes muscles to Ca2+. Muscle contractility is also influenced by variations in the composition of myosin phosphatase. Thus the sensitivity of vascular smooth muscles to regulation by nitric oxide via the activation of cGMPdependent protein kinase 1-alpha depends on the presence of leucine zippers in the splice variants of the large and small Mypt that are expressed in this tissue (339). In chicken gizzard, a developmental switch between leucine zipperpositive and -negative Mypts correlates with the loss of cGMP-mediated myosin relaxation at hatching (203). Other forms of splice variance of the Mypt1-encoding gene have also been implicated in the developmental regulation of muscle contractility (108). The importance of the enzymes that control the contractility of smooth muscles in arteries (193), airways (182), and corpora carvenosa (381) makes them potential targets in the treatment of cardiac and cerebral vascular spasms, asthma, and erectile dysfunction. In striated muscle, contraction is triggered by membrane depolarization. Even though phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain is not required for contraction, it does positively affect the speed and force of contraction (346). Thus a gradient of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation correlates with the pattern of cardiac contraction (99). The role of the Mypt2-based myosin phosphatase in the contraction of striated muscle has been poorly studied. C. Scd5-Associated PP1 Fungi lack Mypt or Neurabin homologs, yet in budding yeast PP1 has also been implicated in the organization of cortical actin. Thus, after shifting of the temperature- sensitive PP1 mutant glc7-10 to a restrictive temperature, the actin ring at the bud neck disappeared, actin cables became rare, and actin no longer showed its typical polarized localization (16). This mutant was also de- ficient in vacuolar fusion and in secretory and endocytotic vesicular transport (292). Strikingly similar phenotypes were observed after the functional disruption of Scd5, Rvs167, or Sla2 (32, 59, 167, 259, 277). Scd5 has been identified as a PP1-binding protein in various screens (173, 372, 374), and recently, it was found that disruption of the RVXF motif of Scd5 that mediates the interaction with PP1 severely disturbed endocytosis and actin organization (78). Rvs167 and Sla2 interact physically and genetically with Scd5 (32, 59, 167, 259). Also, mutation of either Rvs167 or Sla2, like that of PP1, compromised the integrity of the cell wall at high temperatures, presumably because of a disruption in the transport of vesicles with cargoes required for the construction of the cell wall (16, 59, 259). Collectively, the available data indicate that PP1, Scd5, Rvs167, and Sla2 function together in a signaling pathway that regulates vesicular transport and the polarized distribution of actin patches. Possibly, Scd5 targets PP1 to actin patches and vesicles. Potential substrates of Scd5-associated PP1 include the phosphoproteins Sla2, Sla1, and Pan1. The latter two proteins have both been found to interact with PP1 in yeast two-hybrid screens (372, 374) and to be components of a complex involved in actin organization, endocytosis, and cell wall morphogenesis (357). Because homologs of various proteins introduced in this section have been identified in animals, where they have also been implicated in actin organization and endocytosis (167), it is tempting to speculate...	3712	10485

Both of these activities are abolished in adrenalectomized (ADX) mice. LPS-induced pulmonary polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration and nitric oxide (NO) production were also inhibited by CNTF + sCNTFR alpha but not by CNTF alone. sCNTFR alpha did not alter the clearance or tissue distribution of CNTF. Furthermore, CNTF variants coadministered with sCNTFR alpha protected against LPS toxicity in a manner related to their affinity for the beta components of CNTFR. Thus, inhibition of TNF production and protection against LPS lethality by CNTF/sCNTFR alpha require an intact hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and may be mediated by endogenous glucocorticoids. This protective effect is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of PMN infiltration and NO production, and appears to be mediated by cells displaying only beta-receptor subtypes.	88439		104798

CHEBI	acetylcysteine	CHEBI	1-octadec-9-enoylglycero-3-phosphate	hgnc	MAPK1	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...			6871

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124].

In embryos, alterations of the normal pattern of Hox gene expression result in homeotic transformations and malformations. Disruption of the Hoxa1 gene, the most 3' member of the Hoxa cluster and a retinoic acid (RA) direct target gene, results in abnormal ossification of the skull, hindbrain, and inner ear deficiencies, and neonatal death. We have generated Hoxa1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells (named Hoxa1-15) from Hoxa1(-/-) mutant blastocysts to study the Hoxa1 signaling pathway. We have characterized in detail these Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells by performing microarray analyses, and by this technique we have identified a number of putative Hoxa-1 target genes, including genes involved in bone development (e.g. Col1a1, Postn/Osf2, and the bone sialoprotein gene or BSP), genes that are expressed in the developing brain (e.g. Nnat, Wnt3a, BDNF, RhoB, and Gbx2), and genes involved in various cellular processes (e.g. M-RAS, Sox17, Cdkn2b, LamA1, Col4a1, Foxa2, Foxq1, Klf5, and Igf2). Cell proliferation assays and Northern blot analyses of a number of ES cell markers (e.g. Rex1, Oct3/4, Fgf4, and Bmp4) suggest that the Hoxa1 protein plays a role in the inhibition of cell proliferation by RA in ES cells. Additionally, Hoxa1(-/-) ES cells express high levels of various endodermal markers, including Gata4 and Dab2, and express much less Fgf5 after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. Finally, we propose a model in which the Hoxa1 protein mediates repression of endodermal differentiation while promoting expression of ectodermal and mesodermal characteristics.	96170		88454

go	platelet aggregation	hgnc	HSP90B1	hgnc	TLR4	11986223	It is known that Gp96 is released from cells at necrosis induced, for example, by virus infection. Although this event supports the efficient induction of immune responses, it might also interfere with processes that are susceptible to chronic inflammation, such as wound healing after tissue damage. Therefore, Gp96-mediated stimulation of the immune system requires tight regulation. Here we show that human thrombocytes specifically interact with Gp96 and that binding of Gp96 to platelets is enhanced more than 10-fold on activation by thrombin. Gp96 interferes with neither thrombin-induced platelet activation nor platelet aggregation. However, the presence of platelets during Gp96-mediated DC activation reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of DCs.	0070527	12028	11850

(100) observed increased circulating resistin levels in diet-induced and genetic models of obesity. Inhibition of resistin in these models restored insulin action, whereas administration of resistin inhibited insulin action in control animals. Surprisingly, the evidence linking resistin to diabetes and obesity in humans is less clear. Serum content of resistin is unaffected by obesity and insulin resistance in humans (37). Lee et al. (66) compared BMI, fat mass, and insulin action to resistin levels in 243 subjects (male and female) and observed no relationship. There was also no difference in resistin between lean and obese insulin-resistant subjects. Serum resistin can be elevated in Type 2 diabetes patients, but there was no relationship between adiposity and insulin (70), whereas others have reported no difference in obese, obese diabetic, and nonobese subjects (37). Although there are conflicting reports as to the relationship of resistin to adiposity (5), most investigations agree that resistin is not related to insulin resistance (107). To date, there is no information on the interaction between exercise and resistin. Because the role of resistin in regulating insulin action is unclear at this time, there appears to be little rationale to investigate the influence of exercise on this particular adipocytokine. Interleukin (IL-6). IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine secreted by numerous cell types including immune cells, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. In an effort to determine function, Kim et al. (58) pretreated mice with IL-6 before a hyperinsulinemic- euglycemic clamp. IL-6 blunted skeletal muscle glucose disposal as well as IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (58).	6018

CHEBI	dimethyl sulfoxide	CHEBI	1-octadec-9-enoylglycero-3-phosphate	hgnc	MAPK1	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...			6871

CHEBI	glucosamine	SCHEM	serum insulin	hgnc	IRS1	10194465	The ability of a variety of nutrients to activate the hexosamine pathway has led to the theory that this pathway serves as a general nutrient sensing pathway, through which hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia could decrease insulin sensitivity of cells when nutrient excess prevails (148). In cell culture, omission of glutamine (a cofactor of GFA) from the media, or addition of glutamine analogues, blunts the desensitizing effect of glucose on insulin sensitivity (150). Glucosamine infusion for two to six hours will decrease insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, PI3-kinase activation, and activation of glycogen synthase in a manner that parallels the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. This effect can be seen both in acute and chronic stimulation with insulin (151) (Patti, M.E., personal communication).			6125
SCHEM	Butylated hydroxyanisole	hgnc	TNF	fplx	Nfkb Complex	10699758	Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...		11892	NFkappaB

The intravenous injection of LPS elicited an inflammatory response that was characterized by a time-dependent infiltration of neutrophils, lipid peroxidation, microvascular leakage (indicative of microvascular damage), and epithelial cell injury in both the duodenum and jejunum. Administration of the SODm SC-55858, FeTMPS or FeTMPyP at 3 h post LPS reduced the subsequent increase in microvascular leakage, lipid peroxidation and epithelial cell injury.% Our results suggest that O2 and peroxynitrite play a significant role in the pathogenesis of duodenal and intestinal injury during endotoxaemia and that their remoyal by SODm and peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts offers a novel approach to the treatment of septic shock or clinical conditions of gastrointestinal inflammation.			0072672
