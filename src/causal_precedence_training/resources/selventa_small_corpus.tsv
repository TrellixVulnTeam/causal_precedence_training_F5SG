GSK-3 phosphorylation induced by insulin and IGF-1 were eliminated by pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002. In contrast, the effects of 8-Br-cAMP or forskolin on GSK-3 phosphorylation in these cell lines were not altered by inhibition of PI3K activity with wortmannin or LY294002 (Fig. 2A), excluding the possibility that PKA induces GSK-3 phosphorylation through activation of PI3K.			4617

This involvement of PKC in MM cell adhesion to fibronectin was further confirmed by a dose-dependent increment of adhesion triggered by PMA stimulation (Fig. 3d) similar to that induced by VEGF.

SCHEM	Smoke extract, cigarette	fplx	VEGF Family	hgnc	NOS3	16806264	Because NO is an essential mediator of endothelial cell migration and VEGF-induced angiogenesis, we investigated the effect of CSE exposure on VEGF-dependent Akt/eNOS/NO pathway. VEGF-stimulated HUVECs exposed to CSE show a dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylated Akt and eNOS (Fig. 4A). Importantly, the activation of Akt and eNOS by VEGF can be rescued following treatment with the antioxidants NAC and vitamin C (Fig. 4B). Similarly, we found that the induction of NO by VEGF in endothelial cell cultures was severely compromised in the presence of CSE, but that NO levels could be normalized with antioxidants (Fig. 4C). Globally, these data suggest that ROS are involved in the impairment of VEGF-induced Akt/eNOS/NO pathway by CSE.		VEGF	7876

Under these conditions or upon overexpression of wild type Akt, IL-1β-induced IKKβ activity is diminished. Furthermore, a dominant negative mutant of Akt abolishes IKKβ inhibition by CaMKKc and ionomycin, suggesting that Akt acts as a mediator of CaMKK signaling to inhibit IL-1β-induced IKK activity at an upstream target site.
