Methodology:

1. Triples A->B->C were identified in the SIGNOR database
   (https://signor.uniroma2.it) such that the links A->B and B->C both occur at
   least once in the same pathway. Edge types were limited to activations and
   inhibitions. SIGNOR complexes and families were mapped to Famplex when such
   mappings exist. For complexes without Famplex mappings, triples were expanded
   out.  For example the Integrin Signaling pathway in SIGNOR contains the edges
   "A6/B4 integrin" up-regulates activity of "PI3K complex" and "PI3K complex"
   up-regulates activity of "AKT protein family". PI3K complex and AKT protein
   family each has a mapping to Famplex, but no mapping exists for A6/B4
   integrin. The associated triples are then HGNC:ITA6 -> FPLX:PI3K -> FPLX:AKT
   HTNC:ITB4 -> FPLX:PI3K -> FPLX:AKT


2. For each triple A->B->C extracted from SIGNOR by the above procedure, INDRA
   statements are found in the INDRA database for which the links A -> B and B
   -> C have support from REACH extractions taken from the same paper in the
   same reading. Edges are restricted to be directed, (no complexes are
   considered) but polarities are not required to match those in the associated
   SIGNOR triple.  The entities A, B, and C are those after INDRA's grounding
   mapping and word sense disambiguation have been applied and thus may not
   match those in the supporting REACH extractions. Results are further filtered
   to cases where the links A -> B and B -> C have support either from the same
   sentence in the paper, or in neighboring sentences where the sentence
   supporting A -> B occurs before that supporting B -> C.

Description of contents:

The file signor_triple_dataset.csv contains the columns "agent1_name", "agent1",
"agent2_name", "agent2", "agent3_name", "agent3", "signor_stmt_type1",
"signor_stmt_type2", "reach_stmt_type1", "reach_stmt_type2", "sentence_text1",
"sentence_text2", "sentence_id1", "sentence_id2", "reading_id".


"agent{i}_name" contains a canonical name for the ith agent in a triplet
(e.g. GSK3B) and "agent{i} contains a standardized namespace and identifier
for the same agent in the form of a curie "{namespace}:{identifier}"
(e.g. "HGNC:4617".)

"signor_stmt_type1", and "signor_stmt_type2" contain edge types for the
associated SIGNOR statements supporting a triplet (either Activation or
Inhibition).

"reach_stmt_type1" and "reach_stmt_type2" contain the edge
types for the REACH extractions supporting the triplet (extractions from
the same sentence or neighboring sentences in the same paper with the
sentence for A -> B preceding that for B -> C).

"sentence_text1" and "sentence_text2" contain the respective sentences
where the extractions supporting A -> B and B -> C were made. In most cases
these are identical, but in some cases they are neighboring sentences
from a paper.

"sentence_id1" and "sentence_id2" contain the respective sentence-ids for
the sentences as labeled in the REACH json output.

"reading_id" is a key that maps to corresponding REACH output jsons. REACH
output jsons are stored in a tar.gz archive
signor_triple_dataset_reach_output.tar.gz.

Filenames for the output jsons
are of the form "{reading_id}.json" and can be matched up with the results
in signor_triple_dataset.csv through the "reading_id" column.
